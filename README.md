# Stoplight, Streetsign and Person Detection - MAE-ECE 148 Final Project

#### Team Members
Team: Arjun Naageshwaran (MAE Ctrls & Robotics), Hariz Zariman (CE), Arturo Amaya (CE)

#### Final Project
The goal of this project was a three-fold application of computer vision. Using the OAKD Lite camera, we aimed to recognize stoplights, traffic signs and people and use those visual inputs to change the state of our car. 

Primary goals:
1) Red, yellow and green stoplights would make the car stop, slow down, and go
2) Stop signs, speed limit signs, and right turn signs would be recognized and make the car perform their designated function
3) Individuals could be recognized and followed by the car with dynamic throttle and steering, while the car simultaneously recognized and performed stoplight and streetsign functions



## Early Quarter

#### Mechanical Design (Early Quarter)
Prefabricated parts of the car were given to us, but parts like the base plate, dual camera mount, LIDAR stand, and cases for sensitive electronics (VESC, GNSS, Servo PWM, etc.) were either 3D printer or laser cut. These are a few of the models compared to their real-life, 3D printed counterparts.
